# electropystats
Electrostatics using python.

you need python > 2.7 and matplotlib (download at python using commands: python -m pip install -U pip, python -m pip install -U matplotlib )
Please insert desired charges in the file electrostatics.py, using your prefered editor (e.g. notepad, etc), by changing the 11th line of the file, entering the values of charge and position in the x, y plane. for example:

Q = [(10, 1, 0), (-10, -1, 0), (10, 1, 1), (-10, -1, -1), (10, 1, -1), (-10, -1, 1)]  # Charges (Value, x-cord, y-cord)

has 6 charges, with alternating charge (10, -10 ) , in positions 1,0 , -1,0 , 1,1 , -1,1 , 1,-1 , -1,-1 . Change at will, you can also insert or delete charges by adding or deleting charges (e.x. (10, -1, 1) -> delete that to delete the charge of charge 10 (arbitary units) at position -1,1 (arbitary units also) - you can add a charge (e.x. 20, 2, -2) at will by adding the charge, position in x-plane, position in y plane at will. (e.x. (20, 2,-2)).

you can also change the other standart measurements of the file to create alternate spaces - a.o. .

Thank you very much,
